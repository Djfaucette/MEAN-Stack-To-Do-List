# Building a MEAN Application

This is an app built by following:
[Building a MEAN Application](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/building-a-mean-application) on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) by Huston Hedinger and Ken Howard.

# A neat MEAN to-do app that uses Express for routing to MongoDB, Mongoose.js for injection/building a custom schema, and Angular on the front end to bind changes from the user. Also built-in is an API endpoint built with Express, accessible @ ~/api/todos
